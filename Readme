This folder talks about multiple aspects of my journey into statistics. I saw statistics through three main roles: student, teacher, and reseacher. 

This folder shares some material that I used for my research, teaching and studies. In this note, I'm writing a brief overview. 

1. As A Student of Statistics: I'm currently pursuing MS in Business Analytics at University of California, Riverside. This program is jointly offered by the 
   department of statistics and school of business. I'm supposed to take around 5 graduate level statistics courses. So far I have completed three. 
   I have scored a perfect GPA = 4.0/4.0 in the statistics courses. (As on June 25, 2023). 
 
2. Research: I started reading statistics seriously in 2020 during Covid lockdown. I followed my basic passion to culminate my encounter with statistics with something 
            meaningful. I started working on a project which estimates long-run relationships between fertilizer use and soil and human health parameters.
            We used non-parametric statistics techniques for our analysis. The codes, paper draft etc are available under the folder 'Non-parametric Research Paper'. 
            
3. Teacher: The Department of Statistics, University of California Riverside offered my a job of teaching assistant in Winter 2023 and Spring 2023 quarters. 
            I got an opportunity to teach STAT 127: Introduction to Quality Improvement in the winter 2023 quarter and STAT 011 : Statistical Modeling and 
            STAT 010 : Introduction to Statistics in the Spring 2023. 
            
            I share my teaching materials, students feedbacks and codes that I taught students i order to apply statistical concepts in practice.
