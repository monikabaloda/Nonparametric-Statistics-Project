-In this project, we use data over 50 years to estimate the long-run relationship using non-parametric statistical technique. 
-This paper was accepted for presentation in a joint annual conference The Econometric Society and Delhi School of Economics called Winter School 2022, 
          hosted in New Delhi.
-I was awarded "Conference Travel Grant" fellowship worth USD 1100 by the Graduate Student Association
