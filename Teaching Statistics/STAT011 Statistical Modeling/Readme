Statistical modeling teaches fundamental concepts of statistics required for appropriate modeling of relationship between variables. 

My teaching duties include : 

1. Lab sessions in R : I teach application of t-test, Chi-squared test, ANOVA, Linear Regressions, and non parametric tests in R. 

2. Discussion : In these sessions, I discussed theory of the concepts with practical examples. 

3. Grading : Homework, lab, exam gradings. 

4. Office Hourse : One-to-one interactions with students to deliver the better understanding of the course material.

This folder contains syllabus and some material I used for the teaching.
